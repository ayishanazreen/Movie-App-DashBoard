# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- This is a React-based application designed as a Netflix clone, aimed at allowing users to search and view movies. The application demonstrates key React concepts including:

Custom Hooks: Reusable logic for managing state and side effects.
Context API: Global state management across the app to avoid prop-drilling.
React Router: Seamless navigation between different views without full page reloads, simulating multiple pages for different movie details or search results.
Additionally, the project includes a search functionality that allows users to search for movies by title, genre, or other parameters. This functionality is implemented by interacting with a movie API to retrieve and display relevant results dynamically. The frontend is designed with a focus on creating a user-friendly and responsive interface, emulating the design and functionality of popular streaming platforms like Netflix.
